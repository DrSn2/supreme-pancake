NodeJS-based modular website monitoring application

## Background
This project was created out of a need for a simple, solid website monitoring solution while network maintenance took place at my job. Following the maintenance, the utility of having a custom-written monitoring package that performs exactly the way we want/need it became pretty obvious.

## Setup
### Packages
The following 3rd party packages are required from NPM:
* colors
* dateformat
* performance-now
* jsonschema
